## Technologies

For this project we use the following tools:


* [conda](https://github.com/conda/conda) -  cross-platform, language-agnostic binary package manager

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive 

* [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) - hvPlot provides an alternative for the static plotting API provided by Pandas and other libraries

* [google colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) - allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser
